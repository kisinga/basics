A heap is a tree-like structure whose underlying structure is an array.
It can be expressed as a complete tree because all the levels are full except for the lowest level, where some nodes can be empty but all are on the left.  
The structure makes it that the first element is either the smallest or the biggect element, 
depending on the desired order
