A binary search tree is a tree organised as nodes that contain left and right children, which are themselves nodes.  
The first node is called the root.  
The tree is organised such that every left child is less than it's parent, and every right child is greater than it's parent.  
The time complexity of finding a value is o(h), where h is the height of the tree. The relationship between h and the values is logarithmic, so this can be further expressed as O(log n)
