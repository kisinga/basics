This folder contains my implementation of the dynamic connectivity problem. The dynamic connectivity problem is the problem of maintaining the connected components of a graph as edges are added and removed. The problem is also known as the dynamic graph connectivity problem. The problem is a generalization of the static connectivity problem, which is the problem of determining whether two vertices are connected in a graph. The dynamic connectivity problem is a fundamental problem in computer science and has applications in many areas, including network design, social network analysis, and computational biology.
